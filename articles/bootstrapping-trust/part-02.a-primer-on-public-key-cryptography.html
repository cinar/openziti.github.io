<p>It isn&#39;t easy to talk about bootstrapping trust without covering the
basics of public-key cryptography. The reader may skip this article if
the concepts of encryption, signing, and public/private keys are
familiar. However, if not, I implore that you bear the brunt of this
article as later parts will heavily rely on it.</p>
<p>If you wish, you can dive into the mathematics behind it to prove it to
yourself, but I promise, no math here. When necessary, I will wave my
hands at it, point into the distance, and let the reader journey out.</p>
<h3 id="keys">Keys</h3>
<p>Keys are blobs of data containing rather large numbers. They can be
stored anywhere data can be stored, but are commonly stored as files. A
set of public and private keys is referred to as a &quot;key set&quot; or &quot;key
pair.&quot;</p>
<p>Within a key pair, there is only one private key and one public key. The
two keys are mathematically entangled, given a particular function and
its parameters. Today, those functions and parameters are generally
elliptical curves and are the basis of a &quot;trapdoor function.&quot; Trapdoor
functions are attractive to the cryptographically inclined for two main
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>they make it easy to encrypt with one key of a key pair and decrypt
with the other.</li>
<li>one key cannot be derived from the other</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the two keys, the private key is the most important. It must be kept
tucked away from prying eyes and attackers. Some secure environments
store the private key in hardware such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module">Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs)</a>.
Mobile devices, such as laptops and smartphones, use hardware technology
similar to TPMs. Apple has its Secure Enclave, and Android has its
Keymaster Hardware Abstraction Layer. The goal of all of these pieces of
hardware is to keep sensitive secrets (e.g., private keys) safe. The
fact that an entire industry of embedded hardware has been developed to
keep private keys safe should tip the reader off to how important they
are.</p>
<p>As stated above, these two keys have some impressive capabilities. It is
not possible to derive one from the other. This allows the public key to
be handed out freely without compromising the private key. Also, both
keys can generate encrypted data that only the other key can decrypt.
More clearly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anyone with the public key can encrypt data only the private key
holder can decrypt</li>
<li>Anyone with the public key can decrypt data from the private key
holder</li>
</ol>
<p>Number one can succinctly be called &quot;Public Key Encryption&quot; and number
two &quot;Private Key Encryption.&quot; This article explores the merits of both.</p>
<h4 id="public-key-encryption">Public Key Encryption</h4>
<p>From the list above, number one is what most people think of as
&quot;encryption.&quot; It is &quot;secure&quot; as it allows anyone with the widely
available public key to send messages only the private key holder can
read. This property ensures that communication from the public key
holder to the private key holder is being read exclusively by the
intended target.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of pressure to keep the private key extremely safe.
Whoever holds the private key, has a guaranteed identity that is tied to
and verifiable by the public key. It is verifiable because if one can
use the public key to encrypt data, only the private key holder can
decrypt it. This fact means that data can be encrypted and sent that
coordinates on an additional secret. Since only the private key holder
can decrypt the data to see this second level secret, future
communication can use the new secret to encrypted and verify traffic in
both directions. This additional exchange is roughly how part of the TLS
negotiation works for HTTPs. TLS, and by proxy HTTPS, use other
technologies and strategies to provide an incredible security
proposition.</p>
<h4 id="private-key-encryption">Private Key Encryption</h4>
<p>For private key encryption, the same principles apply as with public key
encryption with the roles reversed. The private key encrypts data only
the public key can decrypt. On the surface, this seems absurd. When the
server encrypts data with its private key, the public key can decrypt
it. The public key is not protected and expected to be widely available.
It seems as if private key encryption is nearly useless as everyone can
read it!</p>
<p>Except it isn&#39;t. Private key encryption verifies the identity of the
private key holder. The public key cannot interact with anyone else.
Additionally, this property allows us to generate encrypted data that
could only have come from the private key holder. If that data happens
to be small and describe another document, we call that a &quot;digital
signature&quot; or &quot;signature&quot; for short.</p>
<h3 id="digital-signatures">Digital Signatures</h3>
<p>Digital signatures are similar to handwritten ones used to sign legal
documents and checkbooks, but with a significant advantage. They
validate that a document has not been altered since it was signed. With
today&#39;s computer&#39;s graphical abilities, the nefarious can forge images
and handwritten signatures. That puts handwritten signatures at a
significant disadvantage. So how does this work?</p>
<p>The data that will be signed can be anything. What it represents is not
important. It can be text, JSON, an image, a PDF, or anything at all!
That data is processed by a one-way
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hashing algorithm</a>,
such as SHA-256. This process is idempotent, meaning running it
repeatedly on the same data, parameters, and hashing algorithm gives the
same result. The output of this process is a hash, a string of
characters that uniquely identifies the input data. With sufficiently
large input data, the hash is much shorter than the input data as the
hash size is usually fixed length.</p>
<p>For example, here is the Ziti logo:</p>
<p><img src="images/ziti.png" style="display: block; width: 25%; margin: 0px auto;"></p>
<p>This logo&#39;s file can be hashed using SHA-256 via the <code>sha256sum</code> command
commonly found on Linux.</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; sha256sum ziti.png
c3a6681cc81f9c0fa44b3e2921495882c55f0a86c54cd60ee0fdc7d200ad26db  ziti.png
</code></pre><p>That long string &quot;c3a....6db&quot; is the hash of that file! The string is 64
characters long and is comprised of hex characters (a base 16 numbering
system of 0-9 and a-f). Each character takes four bits to represent (4^2
= 16). Since there are 64 characters at 4 bits each we have: 64 x 4 =
256. This is where SHA-256 gets its name. SHA-256 is a fixed-length
cryptographic hashing algorithm who&#39;s output is 256 bits in length.</p>
<p>The hash itself is not encryption. It is &quot;hashing.&quot; Hashing of this
nature is not reversible while encryption is. For cryptographic hashing,
it is impracticable to have two similar sets of data that have the same
function that produces the same hash. In essence, the hash uniquely
represents the data: all of it! Changing even a single character would
generate a different hash.</p>
<p>After hashing a data or document, the private key holder can encrypt the
hash to generate a signature. This process provides the following truths
when working with the signature:</p>
<ul>
<li>the private key is the only key capable of producing its signature of
the data&#39;s hash</li>
<li>the public key can validate the signature given the data and hashing
algorithm used</li>
</ul>
<p>Verifying a signature a straightforward process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the public key to decrypt the signature to reveal the original
hash</li>
<li>Use the hashing algorithm that was used initially on the data,
recreate the hash independently</li>
<li>Compare the two hashes, and if they are the same the signature is
valid</li>
</ul>
<p>Signing data is incredibly powerful. It allows a private key holder to
state that data was approved by them and not altered. It is also
publicly verifiable to anyone with the document, signature, and public
key. This allows many decentralized approaches to sharing data that can
have its source and content verified.</p>
<p>Bearer tokens are an example of the power of signatures. Bearer tokens
are a document that is signed by a trusted authentication system and
contain data that provides information about the client presenting the
token. Signing the token ensures that the content of the token has not
been changed and has been endorsed by a trusted system. An example of a
bearer token is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token">JSON Web Token (JWT)</a></p>
<p>A JWT specifies the format of the bearer token as a header, payload, and
signature using JSON. A client can then present a JWT to any system
which can then verify that the contents are valid and from a trusted
identity. As long as the signature is valid, the JWT can grant access to
the client presenting it based on whatever information is inside the
JWT.</p>
<h1 id="closing">Closing</h1>
<p>This article should have shed light on public-key cryptography by
explaining the roles of the public and private keys. It should have also
provided a glimpse at the power of encryption and digital signatures. In
<a href="part-03.certificates.html">part three</a> we will see how key pairs can
be combined with certificates!</p>
